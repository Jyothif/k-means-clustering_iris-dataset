# Project overview
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
* Id,
* SepalLengthCm
* SepalWidthCm
* PetalLengthCm
* PetalWidthCm
* Species

 * By using all these attributes, I found it is unsupervised learning and there are different types of clusters which sligtly different from each other but using k-means  clustering sllight difference can be detected.My thought is to project the scenario,which is helpful to detecting in other datasets too.
 
 Data and resources:
 * `Python = 3.7`
 * `numpy,pandas,matplotlib`
 * `scikit-learn`

# Data cleaing: data is very clean
time to Data exploration.
